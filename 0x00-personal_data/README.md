What is PII?
-------------
PII stands for Personally Identifiable Information. It is any data that could potentially identify a specific individual. Any information that can be used to distinguish one person from another and can be used for de-anonymizing anonymous data can be considered PII. PII can be sensitive or non-sensitive. Sensitive PII is information which, when disclosed, could result in harm to the individual whose privacy has been breached. Non-sensitive PII is information that is already available in public records, but which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity. Non-sensitive PII is easily accessible from public sources and can include information such as name, address, phone number, and email address. Sensitive PII, on the other hand, is information that, when disclosed, could result in harm to the individual whose privacy has been breached. Sensitive PII includes information such as social security numbers, driver's license numbers, financial account numbers, and medical information.

What is non-PII?
----------------

Non-PII stands for Non-Personally Identifiable Information. It is any data that cannot be used to identify a specific individual. Non-PII is information that is not linked to any specific individual and is therefore not considered sensitive. Non-PII can include information such as

- IP addresses
- Browser types
- Operating systems
- Device types
- Demographic information
- User behavior data
- Search history
- Cookies
- Clickstream data
- Aggregated data
- Anonymized data

How to implement a log filter that will obfuscate PII fields?
------------------------------------------------------------
To implement a log filter that will obfuscate PII fields, you can use a regular expression to search for PII fields in the log data and replace them with a placeholder value. For example, you can search for social security numbers, driver's license numbers, financial account numbers, and medical information in the log data and replace them with "XXXXX" or another placeholder value. You can also use a library or tool that is specifically designed for obfuscating PII fields in log data. This will help to protect the privacy of individuals whose PII is included in the log data and reduce the risk of a data breach.

How to implement a data masking solution?
-----------------------------------------
To implement a data masking solution, you can use a variety of techniques to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. Some common data masking techniques include:

- Substitution: Replace sensitive data with a placeholder value, such as "XXXXX" or "*****".
- Shuffling: Randomly shuffle the characters in sensitive data to make it unreadable.
- Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data using a cryptographic algorithm and a secret key.

You can also use a combination of these techniques to mask sensitive data in different ways. For example, you can encrypt sensitive data before storing it in a database and then use substitution or shuffling to mask the data when it is displayed to users. This will help to protect the privacy of individuals whose sensitive data is stored in your system and reduce the risk of a data breach.
