Basic Authentication
--------------------

This is a simple example of how to use basic authentication in a Flask
application.

To run the example, you can use the following commands:

```bash
$ export FLASK_APP=basic_auth.py
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```

Then, you can visit `http://
localhost:5000/` in your web browser to see the application.
